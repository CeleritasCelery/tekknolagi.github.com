<h1>I'm Bithiah Koshy.</h1>

A tinkerer, pleb, old soul. Known as vintagemind or devargnes on the World Wide Web. I like to fence, play chess, 
read books, do [ornithology research](https://ebird.org/profile/MzQ1MjU0Mg), and bush walking. 
Currently a high school junior at Texas Tech University K-12 interning at
[Market Mapper](https://www.marketmapper.io/) doing all things content. My other site can be found [here](https://vintagemind.github.io/).

## Things I'm Interested In.

* Technical analysis: Thanks to the current work I do, I very much wish to pursue computational finance which is a blend of computer science, finance, and economics.
  It's a really unique field where I have to do calculus (wonderful). I often see people mix trading with technical analysis and they're two different things. Trading without
  having any knowledge of the markets whatsoever is very similar to Russian roulette in my kind opinion. Technical analysis gives you statistical based reasoning.
  
* [Lightning Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Network): I have a personal
  [node](https://trycinder.com](https://github.com/raspiblitz/raspiblitz)) and wish to be a fulltime node runner (why not?). It is the next
  payment system where anyone and anywhere can transact BTC in form of sats with _very minimal fees_.
  
* Crypto wallets: The complex architecture of wallets regardless whether it's non-custodial, custodial, or browser wallet is a marvel. Having
  used plenty of various kinds of wallets, thinking about security vulnerabilities is really fun for some reason. I highly recommend [Sparrow](https://sparrowwallet.com/),
  [Electrum](https://electrum.org/), and [COLDCARD](https://coldcard.com/) as a basic setup. Always have backups (try [Cryptosteel](https://cryptosteel.com/)).
  
* [Security engineering](https://pentesterlab.com/profile/3c9762377542915b2cc2fbdf94): Personally, security engineering isn't something I want to pursue but having
  the mindset is extremely vital. I like to do [CTFs](https://ctftime.org/team/226953) whenever I have time with tendency to solve OSINT, web, and misc challs.
  welcome [to help keep it running](https://github.com/sponsors/tekknolagi). I would say security engineering on decentralized protocols/applications to be the highest of difficulty.
  Smart contracts are a whole another monster.
  
* Economics: I'm a student memember at [Mises Institute](https://mises.org/) which favors the Austrian School of Economics (a school of thought). Though I favor this ideology
  the most, the understanding of markets and market dynamics has always been an interest to me ever since I met a very knowledgable mentor who was the Vice President
  of Citibank (Australia) in the 1980s to early 1990s. She asked me so many questions and made me ponder on what is fiat money, how can we change that, and so much more.
  I'm forever grateful for her guidance and mentorship.
