<h1>I'm Max Bernstein.</h1>

I am a human and [programmer](https://github.com/tekknolagi). I like to read
books, take photos, and ride bikes in the hills near my house. I [tweet
things](https://twitter.com/tekknolagi) about bread, legumes, and compilers.
Though my official title is Chief Potato, I work as a software engineer
building faster language runtimes.

You can [email me](mailto:contact@bernsteinbear.com) if you so desire. I'm
happy to talk about education, programming languages, cycling, and more.

## I like making things.

That's probably an understatement. Here are some of my favorite projects:

* [Cinder](https://github.com/facebookincubator/cinder), Instagram's
  performance-oriented fork of CPython---try it out on
  [trycinder.com](https://trycinder.com) (which I built!)
* [Skybison](https://github.com/tekknolagi/skybison) (fork of
  [original](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/skybison)), Instagram's
  performance-oriented greenfield implementation of Python
* [shru.gg](https://shru.gg), a website built just so I would have to stop
  finding, copying, and pasting that shrug emoji. If you like it, you are
  welcome [to help keep it running](https://github.com/sponsors/tekknolagi)
* An [Lisp to x86-64 compiler](https://github.com/tekknolagi/ghuloum) I wrote
  in C and accompanying [blog posts](/blog/lisp/)
* The [term paper](/dat-paper/) I wrote for COMP 117 IDS
  analyzing Dat and the Beaker browser
* [Reason](https://reasonml.github.io/), a compiler front-end and toolchain for
  OCaml
* The [final project spec [PDF]](/resources/comp15-homework6.pdf)
  and reference implementation (2016) and
  [independent project spec [PDF]](/resources/comp15-independent.pdf)
  (2016) for the data structures course I TA'ed
* A [distributed ray tracer](https://github.com/TheiaRT/tracer) (2015) that I
  made with friends for a concurrent programming course, with the
  [final writeup [PDF]](/resources/comp50-writeup.pdf)

I like making things [just for fun](https://justforfunnoreally.dev/).

## I like teaching.

* [CS 50ISDT](/isdt/) (2021), a course [Tom](https://tchebb.me/) and I wrote
  and taught at Tufts about software development tooling
* [EXP 57](/excollege/) (2018), a course [Yuki](https://yzan424.github.io/) and
  I wrote and taught at Tufts about personal and professional development

## I kind of maintain a blog.

<del>It's not very interesting just yet.</del> [Things are happening.](/blog/)

## Sometimes I contribute to open source projects.

* [PyPy](https://www.pypy.org/)
  ([!818](https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/merge_requests/848))
* [Cinder](https://github.com/facebookincubator/cinder)
* [Skybison](https://github.com/tekknolagi/skybison)
  (fork of [original](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/skybison))
* [YJIT](https://github.com/Shopify/ruby)
  ([#58](https://github.com/Shopify/ruby/pull/58),
   [#59](https://github.com/Shopify/ruby/pull/59)),
  which now lives in [upstream Ruby](https://github.com/ruby/ruby)
* [CPython](https://www.python.org/)
  ([bpo-36929](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/13392),
  [bpo-38648](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/17002),
  [bpo-42065](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/19940),
  [bpo-42199](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/23031),
  [faster-cpython #546](https://github.com/faster-cpython/ideas/issues/546))
* [Pyre](https://pyre-check.org/)
  ([Refactor protocol inference](https://github.com/facebook/pyre-check/commit/f14577db5940c0b4087fffe209786cd4075f37df))
* [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/)
  ([rC345558](https://reviews.llvm.org/rC345558))
* [Reason](https://github.com/facebook/reason)

Fun fact: this means I have now contributed to four different Python runtimes.
