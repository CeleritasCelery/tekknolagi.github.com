<h1>I'm Max Bernstein.</h1>
<p>
I am a human and <a href="https://github.com/tekknolagi">programmer</a>. I like
to read books, take photos and ride bikes in the hills near my house. I work at
Instagram as a software engineer.
</p>
<p>
You can <a href="mailto:contact@bernsteinbear.com">email me</a> if you so
desire. I'm happy to talk about education, programming languages, cycling, and
more.
</p>

<h2>I like making things.</h2>
<p>
That's probably an understatement. Here are some of my favorite projects:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>An in-progress <a href="https://github.com/tekknolagi/ghuloum">Lisp to x86-64 compiler</a>
	I wrote in C</li>
    <li><a href="/excollege/">EXP 57</a>, a course on professional and personal
        development that I taught at Tufts University with <a
           href="https://yzan424.github.io/">Yuki</a></li>
    <li>The <a href="{% link dat-paper.html %}">term paper</a> I wrote for COMP 117 IDS
        analyzing Dat and the Beaker browser</li>
    <li><a href="https://facebook.github.io/reason/">Reason</a>, a compiler
        front-end and toolchain for OCaml
    </li>
    <li>
        An <a href="https://github.com/tekknolagi/distlisp">automatically
            distributed programming language</a> (2016) for my networks course,
        with the <a href="{% link resources/comp112-writeup.pdf %}">final writeup [PDF]</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        The <a href="{% link resources/comp15-homework6.pdf %}">final project
            spec [PDF]</a> and reference implementation
        (2016) and <a href="{% link resources/comp15-independent.pdf %}">independent
            project spec [PDF]</a> (2016) for the data structures course I TA
    </li>
    <li>
        A <a href="https://github.com/TheiaRT/tracer">distributed ray
            tracer</a> (2015) that I made with friends for a concurrent
        programming course, with
        the <a href="{% link resources/comp50-writeup.pdf %}">final writeup [PDF]</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        A probably bug-ridden <a href="https://github.com/tekknolagi/ssock">C
            sockets library</a> (2014) that I made
        for <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com">Hacktoberfest</a>,
        along with the much
        cleaner <a href="https://github.com/TheiaRT/libiris">C++ sockets
            library</a> (2015) that I made for the distributed ray tracer
    </li>
    <li>
        An unexpectedly
        popular <a href="https://github.com/tekknolagi/carp">virtual machine</a>
        (2014) that got some Hacker News attention, along with its newer and
        much better designed
        <a href="https://github.com/RabbitVM/rabbit">cousin</a> (2016)
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
Many other class projects, while delightful, cannot be published due to
university policy.
