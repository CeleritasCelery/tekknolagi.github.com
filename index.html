    <h2>I'm Maxwell Bernstein.</h2>
    <p>
      I am a <a href="https://github.com/tekknolagi">programmer</a> and
      student at Tufts University.
      I like to <a href="https://photos.bernsteinbear.com">take photos</a>
      and ride bikes in the hills near my house.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can <a href="mailto:contact@bernsteinbear.com">email me</a>
      if you so desire.
    </p>

    <h2>I like making things.</h2>
    <p>
      That's probably an understatement. Here are some of my favorite projects:
      <ul>
        <li>
          A <a href="https://github.com/TheiaRT/tracer">distributed ray tracer</a> that
          I made with friends for a concurrent programming course
        </li>
        <li>
          A probably bug-ridden <a href="https://github.com/tekknolagi/ssock">C sockets library</a>
          that I made for <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com">Hacktoberfest</a> in
          2014
        </li>
        <li>
          A song database <a href="https://github.com/tekknolagi/comp15-songsearch">search
          engine</a> that I made for my data structures class
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>I've really enjoyed my classes.</h2>
    <p>
      Here are some of my favorite classes:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>Compilers</i>, a class about &mdash; guess what? &mdash; building compilers!
          We built one in ML.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Security CTF</i>, a half-credit course in which we build a secure
          device, swap with another school, and then break into theirs
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Concurrent Programming</i>, a class all about multithreading
          and parallel computation
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Operating Systems</i>, a class that does an in-depth study of Linux
          and common operating systems constructs
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Machine Structure &amp; Intel Assembly Programming</i>, in which
          students spend around 40 hours per week writing lots of C
        </li>
      </ul>
