<h1>I'm Max Bernstein.</h1>
<p>
I am a <a href="https://github.com/tekknolagi">programmer</a> and student at
Tufts University. I like to <a href="http://photos.bernsteinbear.com">take
    photos</a> and ride bikes in the hills near my house.

<p>
You can <a href="mailto:contact@bernsteinbear.com">email me</a> if you so
desire.

<h2>I like making things.</h2>
<p>
That's probably an understatement. Here are some of my favorite projects:
<ul>
    <li>
        An automatically distributed Lisp in Erlang (2016) for my networks
        course
    </li>
    <li>
        The <a href="/resources/comp15-homework6.pdf">final project [PDF]</a>
        (2016) and <a href="/resources/comp15-independent.pdf">independent
            project [PDF]</a> (2016) for the data structures course
    </li>
    <li>
        A <a href="https://github.com/TheiaRT/tracer">distributed ray
            tracer</a> (2015) that I made with friends for a concurrent
        programming course, with
        the <a href="/resources/comp50-writeup.pdf">final writeup [PDF]</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        A probably bug-ridden <a href="https://github.com/tekknolagi/ssock">C
            sockets library</a> (2014) that I made
        for <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com">Hacktoberfest</a>,
        along with the much
        cleaner <a href="https://github.com/TheiaRT/libiris">C++ sockets
            library</a> (2015) that I made for the distributed ray tracer
    </li>
    <li>
        An unexpectedly
        popular <a href="https://github.com/tekknolagi/carp">virtual machine</a>
        (2014) that got some Hacker News attention, along with its newer and
        much better designed
        <a href="https://github.com/RabbitVM/rabbit">cousin</a> (2016)
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>I've really enjoyed my classes.</h2>
<p>
Here are some of my favorites:
<ul>
    {% for class in site.data.classes %}
    <li><i>{{ class.name }}</i> with {{ class.prof }}, {{ class.desc }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
</p>

<h2>I kind of maintain a blog.</h2>
<p>
