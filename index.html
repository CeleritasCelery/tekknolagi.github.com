<h1>I'm Max Bernstein.</h1>
<p>
  I am a <a href="https://github.com/tekknolagi">programmer</a> and
  student at Tufts University. I am currently employed at
  <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>.
  I like to <a href="http://photos.bernsteinbear.com">take photos</a>
  and ride bikes in the hills near my house.
</p>
<p>
  You can <a href="mailto:contact@bernsteinbear.com">email me</a> if you so
  desire.

<h2>I like making things.</h2>
<p>
  That's probably an understatement. Here are some of my favorite projects:
  <ul>
    <li>
      The <a href="/resources/comp15-homework6.pdf">final project [PDF]</a>
      (2016) and <a href="/resources/comp15-independent.pdf">independent
        project [PDF]</a> (2016) for the data structures class
    </li>
    <li>
      A <a href="https://github.com/TheiaRT/tracer">distributed ray
        tracer</a> (2015) that I made with friends for a concurrent
      programming course, with
      the <a href="/resources/comp50-writeup.pdf">final writeup [PDF]</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      A probably bug-ridden <a href="https://github.com/tekknolagi/ssock">C
        sockets library</a> (2014) that I made
      for <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com">Hacktoberfest</a>,
      along with the much
      cleaner <a href="https://github.com/TheiaRT/libiris">C++ sockets
        library</a> (2015) that I made for the distributed ray tracer
    </li>
    <!--
      <li>
      A song
      database <a href="https://github.com/tekknolagi/comp15-songsearch">search
      engine</a> (2014) that I made for my data structures class
      </li>
    -->
    <li>
      An unexpectedly
      popular <a href="https://github.com/tekknolagi/carp">virtual machine</a>
      (2014) that got some Hacker News attention, along with its newer and
      much better designed
      <a href="https://github.com/RabbitVM/rabbit">cousin</a> (2016)
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>I've really enjoyed my classes.</h2>
<p>
  Here are some of my favorites:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <i>Compilers</i> with Sam Guyer, a class about &mdash; guess what?
      &mdash; building compilers in ML
    </li>
    <li>
      <i>Security CTF</i> with Ming Chow, a half-credit course in which we
      build a secure device, swap with another school, and then break into
      theirs
    </li>
    <li>
      <i>Concurrent Programming</i> with Mark Sheldon, a class all about
      multithreading and parallel computation
    </li>
    <li>
      <i>Operating Systems</i> with Alva Couch, a class that does an
      in-depth study of Linux and common operating systems constructs
    </li>
    <li>
      <i>Machine Structure &amp; Intel Assembly Programming</i> with Mark
      Sheldon, in which students spend around 40 hours per week writing lots
      of C
    </li>
  </ul>
