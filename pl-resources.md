title: Programming languages resources
---

This page is a collection of my favorite resources for people getting started
writing programming languages. I hope to keep it updated as long as I continue
to find great stuff.

## Compilers

* Tufts [compilers course](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~sguyer/classes/comp181-2006/)
  (2006, but it's been taught more recently. I should probably ping Sam.)
* Abdulaziz Ghuloum's [minimal Scheme to x86 compiler](/assets/img/11-ghuloum.pdf)
* Nora Sandler's [minimal C compiler](https://norasandler.com/2017/11/29/Write-a-Compiler.html)
* Jack Crenshaw's [let's build a compiler](https://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/)
* [Recursive descent parsing](http://web.archive.org/web/20170712044658/https://ryanflannery.net/teaching/common/recursive-descent-parsing/)
  in C. Note that this just verifies the input string, and more has to be done
  to build a tree out of the input.
* Vidar Hokstad's [Writing a compiler in Ruby, bottom up](http://hokstad.com/compiler)
* My [adaptation](https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-0/) of
  Ghuloum's paper
* Rui Ueyama's [chibicc](https://github.com/rui314/chibicc), a C compiler in
  the Ghuloum style

  compiler

* Mario Wolczko's [CS 294-113](http://www.wolczko.com/CS294/), a course on
  managed runtimes

  blog post
* Justin Meiners and Ryan Pendelton's [Write your own virtual machine](https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/)

## Runtime optimization

Here are some resources I have found useful for understanding the ideas and
research around optimizing dynamic languages.

* [Efficient implementation of the Smalltalk-80 system](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800017.800542)
* [Optinizing dynamically-typed object-oriented languages with polymorphic inline caches](https://bibliography.selflanguage.org/_static/pics.pdf)
* [An inline cache isn't just a cache](https://www.mgaudet.ca/technical/2018/6/5/an-inline-cache-isnt-just-a-cache)
* [Baseline JIT and inline caches](https://blog.pyston.org/2016/06/30/baseline-jit-and-inline-caches/)
* [Javascript hidden classes and inline caching in V8](https://richardartoul.github.io/jekyll/update/2015/04/26/hidden-classes.html)
* [Garbage collection in a large LISP system](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800055.802040)

### Pointer tagging and NaN boxing

Resources on representing small values efficiently.

* nikic's [Pointer magic...](https://nikic.github.io/2012/02/02/Pointer-magic-for-efficient-dynamic-value-representations.html)
* Sean's [NaN-Boxing](https://sean.cm/a/nan-boxing)
* zuiderkwast's [nanbox](https://github.com/zuiderkwast/nanbox)
* albertnetymk's [NaN Boxing](http://albertnetymk.github.io/2016/08/06/nan_boxing/)
* Ghuloum's [Incremental approach](http://scheme2006.cs.uchicago.edu/11-ghuloum.pdf)
  (PDF), which introduces this in a compiler setting
* Chicken Scheme's [data representation](https://wiki.call-cc.org/man/4/Data%20representation)
* Guile Scheme's [Faster Integers](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/manual/html_node/Faster-Integers.html)
* Femtolisp [object implementation](https://github.com/JeffBezanson/femtolisp/blob/master/flisp.h)
* Leonard Sch√ºtz's [NaN Boxing](https://leonardschuetz.ch/blog/nan-boxing/) article
* Piotr Duperas's [NaN boxing or how to make the world dynamic](https://piotrduperas.com/posts/nan-boxing/)

### Just-In-Time compilers

Small JITs to help understand the basics. Note that these implementations tend
to focus on the compiling ASTs or IRs to machine code, rather than the parts of
the JIT that offer the most performance: inline caching and code inlining.
Compiling is great but unless you're producing good machine code, it may not do
a whole lot.

* Antonio Cuni's [jit30min](https://github.com/antocuni/jit30min)
* Christian Stigen Larsen's [Writing a basic x86-64 JIT compiler from scratch in stock Python](https://csl.name/post/python-jit/)
* Ben Hoyt's [Compiling Python syntax to x86-64 assembly for fun and (zero) profit](https://benhoyt.com/writings/pyast64/)
* My very undocumented (but hopefully readable)
  [implementation](https://github.com/tekknolagi/ghuloum) of the Ghuloum
  compiler

### Assembler libraries

Sometimes you want to generate assembly from a host language. Common use cases
include compilers, both ahead-of-time and just-in-time. Here are some libraries
that can help with that.

* [x86-64 assembler in C](https://gist.github.com/tekknolagi/201539673cfcc60df73ef75a8a9b5896),
  which I forked from the pervognsen's [original](https://gist.github.com/pervognsen/9d815016d8ef39f1b2c8e509ee2cf052)
* Dart's [multi-arch assembler in C++](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/tree/1e24fe7d699a1c36be142afa21859c6a9c82d035/runtime/vm/compiler/assembler)
  and [relevant constants](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/1e24fe7d699a1c36be142afa21859c6a9c82d035/runtime/vm/constants_x64.h),
  both of which need some extracting from the main project
* Strongtalk's [x86 assembler in C](https://github.com/talksmall/Strongtalk/tree/39b336f8399230502535e7ac12c9c1814552e6da/vm/asm)
* AsmJit, a [multi-arch assembler in C++](https://github.com/asmjit/asmjit)
* [PeachPy](https://github.com/Maratyszcza/PeachPy), an x86-64 assembler in Python

For more inspiration, check out some of the assemblers in runtimes I mention in
my [Compiling a Lisp](/blog/compiling-a-lisp-8/#assembler-libraries) post.

### Things I want to write about

I have not written much about runtime optimization yet, but I would like to
write about:

* Tagged pointers and small objects (strings, integers, sentinel objects, ...)
* Assembly interpreters (known to the JDK folks as a "template interpreter")
* Inline caching for attribute lookup
* Inline caching for method lookup &amp; call
  * Including caching JITed assembly stubs &amp; entrypoints instead of just offsets
* Opcode rewriting and runtime opcode specialization
* Attaching intrinsic functions or assembly stubs to well-known functions
* Heap and GC characteristics from the "Garbage collection in a large Lisp
  system" paper
* Fast paths for common cases ("do less")
* JIT intermediate representations and how they help solve problems around
  megamorphic call sites, inlining, etc
* The GDB JIT interface &amp; maintaining a parseable stack for unwinding

## Game Boy Emulators

  [here](https://gbdev.io/pandocs/)?), which give technical data about the Game
  Boy hardware, I/O ports, flags, cartridges, memory map, etc

[This](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2017/11/03/) is a potentially fun way to
render the screen without SDL, but only for non-interactive purposes.

This [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLye7LM1YVhDHR4TGMklN3tMt_J2jIrn1w)
playlist looks like it could be worth a watch, but it's a lot of hours.
