title: Programming languages resources
---

This page is a collection of my favorite resources for people getting started
writing programming languages. I hope to keep it updated as long as I continue
to find great stuff.

## Compilers

* Tufts [compilers course](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~sguyer/classes/comp181-2006/)
  (2006, but it's been taught more recently. I should probably ping Sam.)
* Abdulaziz Ghuloum's [minimal Scheme to x86 compiler](/assets/img/11-ghuloum.pdf)
* Nora Sandler's [minimal C compiler](https://norasandler.com/2017/11/29/Write-a-Compiler.html)
* Jack Crenshaw's [let's build a compiler](https://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/)

## Lisp specific

* kanaka's [mal](https://github.com/kanaka/mal)
* leo (lwh)'s [Building LISP](https://www.lwh.jp/lisp/)
* Peter Michaux's [Scheme from Scratch](http://peter.michaux.ca/articles/scheme-from-scratch-introduction)
* Daniel Holden's [Build Your Own Lisp](http://buildyourownlisp.com/contents)
* Anthony C. Hay's fairly readable [Lisp interpreter in 90 lines of C++](http://howtowriteaprogram.blogspot.com/2010/11/lisp-interpreter-in-90-lines-of-c.html)
* My own [Writing a Lisp](https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/lisp/) blog post
  series

## Runtimes

* munificent's [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) book
* Mario Wolczko's [CS 294-113](http://www.wolczko.com/CS294/), a course on
  managed runtimes
* My own [bytecode compiler/VM](https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/bytecode-interpreters/)
  blog post

## Lists

copy onto this page.</aside>
