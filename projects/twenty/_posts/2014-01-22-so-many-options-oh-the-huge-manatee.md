If I could do anything, I would travel to beautiful places and take gorgeous photos. I suppose my fancy end goal would be to get published, but that feels secondary. I have wanted for quite some time to bike across parts of Southeast Asia with my camera, snapping away. I really enjoy photos taken randomly on the street, like this one from New York:

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span10 offset1 inline-photo">
    <img src="/assets/img/projects/twenty/heineken.jpg" />
  </div>
</div>

I would be proud of this particular project for a few reasons: it would demonstrate some kind of responsibility, I would be in some of the most beautiful places on earth and able to capture that, and, if I got published, I'd have completed my end goal.

I could make this project a reality if I keep the places relatively close by; anywhere near the Bay Area is probably fair game... but then again I am visiting Carleton next week! It should be a strange and desolate kind of beautiful in Minnesota.

Not much is standing in my way except for the fact that I have yet to take any formal photography classes... perhaps that will be a part of this project? It will probably be useful to learn theory and some technique.

In all seriousness, though, I do think I want to pursue the hackathon as my project. After all, I've already started... <a href="http://hackweekend.io">HackWeekend?</a> I think so!
