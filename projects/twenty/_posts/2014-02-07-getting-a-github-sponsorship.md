Nobody is responding. Not GitHub, not Facebook, not Google. And it's frustrating &mdash; it really is. We *need* a venue and sponsors in order to plan... well, everything else!

I've pinged my contacts, and Jonathan has pinged his. It could be, however, that it's not even a matter of reminders; perhaps it is due to the fact that these are all decently large companies, with a good amount of bureaucracy and protocol to get through.

If this doesn't fall through then I shall try and get Goldman Sachs as a larger sponsor through familial connections. Then the hackathon won't end up being the Bay Area company hackathon that we are aiming for, but we can still inspire people to learn to code... hopefully.

I will speak to my mentor (Christopher Kuszmaul) for advice on how to proceed.
