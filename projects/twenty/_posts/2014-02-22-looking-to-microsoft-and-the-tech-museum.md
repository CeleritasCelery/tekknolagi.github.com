I received word from an engineer at GitHub that it would be wise to look into contacting Microsoft; they are very event-friendly and are always on the lookout for things like this. It turns out that Microsoft also has a partnership or close relationship with the Computer History Museum, so that's an idea...

I now have to figure out if anyone in or close to my planning group has connections to Microsoft. Otherwise, this could be tricky/delayed.

If the Computer History Museum ends up not working, we can try the Tech Museum in San Jose. The only issue that presents, though, is that we will have to get people to San Jose. It's easier than San Francisco, but still, the problem persists.

Another rather early-stage company that I should speak to is Yubico; they are local and make a product that deals with privacy and security.

Last thoughts: other people in my group do not seem to be doing much of any work. I recognize that one of them is in the middle of high school applications (he wants to go to a boarding school), but it's a tad ridiculous. I can't do this on my own.
