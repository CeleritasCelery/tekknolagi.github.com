title: Definite assignment analysis for Python
series: runtime-opt
---

Python is kind of a funky language. It's very flexible about its variable
bindings, which is unusual.

In this one, `x` is not defined in the body and assumed to be a global. You can
tell because there is a `LOAD_GLOBAL` in the bytecode.

```python
import dis
def test():
    return x
dis.dis(test)
#   3           0 LOAD_GLOBAL              0 (x)
#               2 RETURN_VALUE
```

In this one, because there is an assignment in the body---even though it is
after the variable use and technically dead code---the compiler infers `x` to
be a local. You can tell because there is a `LOAD_FAST` in the bytecode.

```python
import dis
def test():
  return x
  x = 1
dis.dis(test)
#   3           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)
#               2 RETURN_VALUE
```

So what happens if you run it? The compiler did not produce an error when
compiling this code so clearly the error must be handled at runtime---and
hopefully not be a segmentation fault.

```python
def test():
  return x
  x = 1
test()
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "<stdin>", line 4, in <module>
#   File "<stdin>", line 2, in test
# UnboundLocalError: local variable 'x' referenced before assignment
```
