I decided to write my first Chrome extension the other day. I was on Reddit somewhere with slow internet, and gifs were taking *forever* to load. <a href="http://gfycat.com/">gfycat</a>, however, turns gifs into WebM videos &mdash; thereby decreasing filesize and increasing load speed. I started manually loading the gifs, but that took forever. Why not write a Chrome extension? My journey began.
