description: A collection of bread ingredient ratios
---

I like making bread. This page has some simplified recipes for different tasty
breads. It's mostly a reference for myself because sometimes I forget the
ratios, and many a website will list ingredients by volume. Maybe some day I
will post pictures and more detail. Until then, you can enjoy my [bread
journey](https://twitter.com/tekknolagi/status/1201209094259888128) on Twitter.

## Notes

All the percentages on this page are in terms of mass, not volume. Mass and
volume are interchangeable for things like water, which are not very
compressible, but not for ingredients like flour.

You may notice that the percentages do not add up to 100%. This is expected;
they are percentages of the total flour in the recipe, not the total dough. For
a recipe that says "100% flour" and "80% water", you can pick 1000g of flour
and 800g of water.

Water is variable in all of the following recipes. I prefer handling high
hydration dough, so I use 80% water.

## White loaf

```
Ingredient       Percent
----------       -------
White flour        100 %
Water               80 %
Salt                 2 %
Yeast                1 %
           OR
Sourdough levain    20 %
```

I like [King Arthur's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmxDKuGLWuE) videos on
shaping and pretty much everything else.

## White/wheat loaf

```
Ingredient       Percent
----------       -------
White flour         80 %
Wheat flour         20 %
Water               80 %
Salt                 2 %
Yeast                1 %
           OR
Sourdough levain    20 %
```

## Focaccia

```
Ingredient       Percent
----------       -------
White flour        100 %
Water               80 %
Olive oil            8 %
Salt                 2 %
Yeast                1 %
```

Additional water, olive oil, salt, and herbs required for topping.

I like how [this man from Genoa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEKzIshoYiM)
makes his focaccia. I learned a lot from his shaping and poking and dressing.

## Miscellaneous

### Small tips

It's easier to pour flour into water and mix it up than the other way around.
This helps avoid flour getting stuck on the bottom of your bowl.

### Suggested baking tools

* Mixing bowl
* Kitchen scale, ideally accurate to 1g
* Saran wrap or equivalent, if leaving the dough in the fridge overnight to
  ferment
* Spatula or bowl scraper, for getting the dough out of the bowl
* Hands or stand mixer
* Cotton hand-towel big enough to cover the whole bowl and drape over
* A warm place (70-80F). Could be your kitchen if it’s the right temperature,
  your oven with the oven light on, your oven with a container of hot water in
  it, a proofing chamber if you are feeling particularly luxurious, ...
* Oven
* Mitts/thick towels for handling hot containers
* A container to bake in, like a cast-iron dutch oven. A baking sheet is also
  probably fine but your bread will spread out more and it will be harder to
  get a nice crust. I also don’t have experience baking bread on just a baking
  sheet. Loaf pans are great for baking loaves.
