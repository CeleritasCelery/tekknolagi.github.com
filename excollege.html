            <h2>What is the course called?</h2>
            <p>
            It's called <i>Tech Trends and Careers: Tufts and Beyond</i>
            <sup id="fnref:naming"><a href="#fn:naming" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.
            </p>

            <h2>Who should take this class?</h2>
            <p>
            Anyone, really! We're trying to get Tufts people settled into
            fulfilling careers after they graduate. We will reserve a good
            amount of space for freshmen and sophomores who might otherwise be
            rather confused.
            </p>

            <h2>Why should I take it?</h2>
            <p>
            Ever wonder what options you might have in tech? Already interested
            in tech but not sure how to start your job search? Already in the
            job search but need some help? This class is the right class for
            you!
            </p>
            <p>
            We're going to try and get people in this class interested in
            one topic or another, started on a personal project, and generally
            plugged in to this wild new world of computer science.
            </p>

            <h2>What about the pre-requisites?</h2>
            <p>
            Eh. We technically &#8220;require&#8221; COMP 11 or an equivalent,
            but really what we want is a base ability to code something, and an
            eagerness to learn more.
            </p>
            <p>
            Since people will be working on independent projects, this is
            somewhat important. But COMP 11 as a corequisite should be totally
            fine.
            </p>

            <h2>Who is teaching it?</h2>
            <p>
            Well,
            <blockquote>
                &#8220;<b>Yuki Zaninovich</b> and <b>Max Bernstein</b> are seniors
                majoring in Computer Science.  When they are not studying,
                eating, sleeping, being TAs for their favorite classes, or
                socializing, they are searching for jobs. Yuki has interned
                twice at Amazon, and Max has interned for such companies as
                GitHub and Facebook.&#8221;
            </blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>
            ...or so says the course catalog.
            </p>

            <h2>Will this course actually use blockchain technology or big
                data to disrupt my job hunt?</h2>
            <p>No. But you might be able to use either or both in your
            project.</p>

            <h2>So who should I contact if I have more questions?</h2>
            <p>
            You can reach both of us at
            <code>exp57 <b>at</b> bernsteinbear <b>dot</b> com</code></a>.
            We would be delighted to answer questions.

                    We didn't name it that. That's what the Ex College chose
                    for us after a back-and-forth conversation. We tried to
                    name it something like:
                    <ul>
                        <li><i>How to get a job without really trying: tried
                                and true methods</i>, or</li>
                        <li><i>Let your career bloom: a non-florist's guide to
                                tech jobs</i>, or</li>
                        <li><i>Google, SpaceX, the FBI, an NGO: Oh, the places
                                youâ€™ll go!</i></li>
                    </ul>
                    ... but they weren't so fond of the humor.
